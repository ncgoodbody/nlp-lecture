    "**What is sentiment analysis?** Sentiment analysis is when we use NLP techniques to study emotion in text or voice data. Our task today is to conduct sentiment analysis on movie reviews from [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/). In this case, we'll build a model that predicts whether a reviewer feels positive or negative about a movie based on the text of their review.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do sentiment analysis on movie reviews?** Production and distribution companies often adjust their advertising strategies for a film after seeing how audiences react to it. Being able to gage public sentiment in social media venues like Twitter in real time would provide an enormous advantage to these companies. This is one way sentiment analysis is  used in the private sector.\n",

    "- **1. Import and Explore:** In order to build our model, we'll have to evaluate the characteristics of our reviews.\n",
    "- **2. Preprocess:** Since we can't build a model with unstructured text data, we'll need to vectorize our dataset. \n",
    "- **Optional:** Remove *stop words* and add *n-grams*.\n",
    "- **3. Build and Train:** Once we have our vectors, we'll assemble a data pipeline, train our model, and evaluate its performance.\n",
    "\n",

    "One strategy for solving the word order problem that we discussed above is to create new features for our data called **n-grams**. These are columns that correspond to *sequences of tokens*. All of the vectorizers we've seen have an `ngram_range` argument that allow us to add sequences. In this case, let's add sequences of two words — also called **bigrams** — to our data. This can improve model performance."
